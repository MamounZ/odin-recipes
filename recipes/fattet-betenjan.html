		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>5 cups water, or as needed</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
			<li>3 medium eggplants, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
			<li>4 (6 inch) pita bread rounds</li>
			<li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
			<li>3 ¼ cups plain yogurt</li>
			<li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
			<li>½ medium lemon, juiced</li>
			<li>3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
			<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
			<li>¼ cup sliced almonds</li>
			<li>1 head romaine lettuce, thinly sliced</li>
			<li>1 (29 ounce) can chickpeas, drained</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Pour water and 2 tablespoons salt into a large bowl. Add cubed eggplant and let sit for 30 minutes. Drain and place on paper towel-lines plates until completely dry, about 30 more minutes.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Chop pita bread into 1-inch cubes and place on a baking sheet.</li>
			<li>Roast in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until golden, 8 to 10 minutes; do not burn. Remove from the oven and set aside.</li>
			<li>Heat 1/2 inch oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Working in batches, fry eggplant until golden, about 6 minutes per batch. Remove to paper towel-lined plates to drain.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, combine yogurt, mayonnaise, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed.</li>
			<li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a small frying pan. Add almonds and cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring often, until nicely brown and toasted, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Remove from the heat.</li>
			<li>Place lettuce on a serving platter. Layer with eggplant, chickpeas, and roasted pita bread. Pour yogurt mixture over top and sprinkle with toasted almonds. Serve at room temperature or cold.</li>
