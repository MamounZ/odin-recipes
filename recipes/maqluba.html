		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Maqluba is a traditional Arabic dish with layers of meat or chicken, rice, and vegetables seasoned with spices. It's flipped upside down and served with plain yogurt and a chopped salad to mix with the rice dish. This is a very easy and crowd-pleasing recipe.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
			<li>6 cups water</li>
			<li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons ground allspice</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
			<li>3 whole cardamom seeds</li>
			<li>4 whole cloves</li>
			<li>3 bay leaves</li>
			<li>2 ½ cups uncooked basmati rice, rinsed and drained</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons ground allspice</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
			<li>1 large potato, sliced into rounds</li>
			<li>1 large head cauliflower, separated into florets</li>
			<li>2 medium tomatoes, diced</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Place chicken in a large pot with 6 cups water, onion, 2 tablespoons allspice, ground cardamom, cardamom seeds, whole cloves and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, and cook until chicken is tender, about 40 minutes. Remove chicken, strain and reserve broth.</li>
			<li>Soak rice in water while waiting for chicken to cook. When chicken is almost done, drain water off, and stir in 1 ½ tablespoons of allspice.</li>
			<li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry potatoes and cauliflower in hot oil until browned. They do not need to fully cook.</li>
			<li>Layer fried potatoes on the bottom of a separate pot. This is done so that the rice will not stick to the bottom of the pan. Add cauliflower and tomatoes, and sprinkle a handful of rice over the vegetables. Remove the bones from the chicken and place the chicken in the pot. Cover with remaining rice. Pour in reserved broth until it reaches a level about 1/2 inch above the level of the rice. Cover the pot, and cook over medium-low heat until rice is tender, about 1 hour.</li>
			<li>Uncover the pot, and place a large round tray over the top. Invert so that the pan is upside down on top of the tray. Let stand for 5 minutes like this, then slowly remove the pot to let the food fall onto the tray.</li>
